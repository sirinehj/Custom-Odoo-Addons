<!--
security file have the rules of user to edit create read and delete in database
it need to be set the path in __manifest__.py on data:[]

the rules will be in a file named ir.model.access.csv
in the csv file you need to write rules in this form:
notice:permitions is a value of 1 and 0
id,name,model_id:id,groupe_id:id,permition_read,permition_write,permition_create,permition_unlink(delete)
in my case read only permition
books.access_proerties,access_books_properties,books.model,base.group_user,1,0,0,0
now copy it and add it to books_manager too and they have all access with diffrent id and name
by relacing base by the _name in the model file "Books" and group_user by record id "books_manager"
then change the id of the rule and the name just add manager in the end
books.access_proerties_manager,access_books_properties_manager,books.model,Books.books_manager,1,1,1,1

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but for me the err security solved when i just make in the csv file this:
id,name,model_id:id,groupe_id:id,permition_read,permition_write,permition_create,permition_unlink
books.access_proerties,access_books_properties,books.model,base.group_user,1,0,0,0
books.access_proerties,access_books_properties,books.model,,1,1,1,1
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
then add it in the __manifest__.py on data:[]
