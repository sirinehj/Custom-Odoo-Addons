#1 create a new module in /models the /models/my_model.py and /models/__init__.py
#2 create /security/my_model_access.xml and create 
#3 run odoo server to gives access rules then create /security/ir.model.access.csv with those rules
#4 create /views/my_model_views.xml and /views/my_model_menus.xml 
#5 never forget to update the __manifest__.py file 
#6 make sure of __init__.py[from . import models] and /model/__init__.py [from . import my_model]

# like any project _manifest_.py and _init_.py need to be alimented by the basics
# create static/src/components
# maybe he will show an exemple so he made static/src/components/exemple/exemple.js 
# and static/src/components/exemple/exemple.xml

# so now we will fill exemple.xml and exemple.js
