# like any project _manifest_.py and _init_.py need to be alimented by the basics
# but not like the backend we will leave the _init_.py empty for now and create
# static/src/components
# maybe he will show an exemple so he made static/src/components/exemple/exemple.js 
# and static/src/components/exemple/exemple.xml
# the first step was to create the first templet and imported in the odoo server at the login
# so now we will fill exemple.xml and exemple.js
