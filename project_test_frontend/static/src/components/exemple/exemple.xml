<!--so first thing here we have syntax like-->
<!--
    <templates>
        this t could be the first templete of templetes and it has a name in t-name attribute
        remember to put the technical name of the model in odoo apps we can see it in the developer mode
        then the name of the template is like project_test_frontend.Exemple
        and the owl="1" is to use the owl framework in odoo
        <t t-name="model-templete/project-templete" owl="1">
            it like a content here
            <p>Text here</p>
            xml files in odoo can use bootstrap and fa-icons
            <button class="btn btn-primary">click me</button>
        </t>
    </templates>
    at the end we go to the js file generally the js and xml files here looks that they have 
    the same name so exemple.js and exemple.xml
-->
<templates>
  <t t-name="project_test_frontend.Exemple" owl="1">
    <p>Text here</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary">click me</button>
  </t>
</templates>
